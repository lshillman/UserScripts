# YouTube: Hide thirst traps in suggested video sidebar

YouTube includes an ad at the top of the "suggested video" sidebar on every video page. For the past few months, they've been nothing but formulaic thirst traps, with an occasional monster truck as a treat. This script hides that ad from the sidebar.

# Installation

* Step 1: install the [Greasemonkey addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox.
* Step 2: install [youtube_hide_thirst_traps.user.js](#). If you've installed Greasemonkey, all you should have to do is click the link, and Greasemonkey will prompt you to install.

That's it!
