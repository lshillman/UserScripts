# Bellinger's Button Boxes: Filter Sold Items

Bellinger's Button Boxes is a lovely business that sells accordions. But the site is full of accordions that have been sold, which I want to remove when I'm shopping. This script adds a button that hides them when clicked.

# Installation

* Step 1: install the [Greasemonkey addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox or [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome.
* Step 2: install [bellingers-filter-sold.user.js](https://github.com/lshillman/UserScripts/raw/main/Bellinger%27s%20Button%20Boxes%3A%20Filter%20Sold%20Items/bellingers-filter-sold.user.js). If you've installed Greasemonkey, all you should have to do is click the link, and Greasemonkey will prompt you to install.

That's it!
