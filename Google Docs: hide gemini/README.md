# Google Docs: Hide Gemini
This AI bs is getting ridiculous. I disable all the "smart" features, but the UI bits are is still there, waiting for me to accidentally click on them so they can prompt me to re-enable it. It's annoying and I hate it.

This script uses CSS to hide the following pieces of the Gemini ui on Google Docs, which seems like everything at the time of writing, though I can't guarantee I haven't missed something:
* gemini button in top nav
* "help me write" context menu item
* "help me write" sidebar button
* Inline "refine" button that pops up whenever you select text

# Installation

* Step 1: install the [Greasemonkey addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox or [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome.
* Step 2: install [gdocs_hide_gemini.user.js](https://github.com/lshillman/UserScripts/raw/refs/heads/main/Google%20Docs:%20hide%20gemini/gdocs_hide_gemini.user.js). If you've installed Greasemonkey, all you should have to do is click the link, and Greasemonkey will prompt you to install.

That's it!
