# LinkedIn: Decrease Attention Theft

I don't want to spend more time on LinkedIn than I need to. LinkedIn's product managers disagree, and want me to spend all my free time there. They accomplish this via several devious methods, but I find—for myself—that the worst ones are the sidebars ("People also viewed", etc) and the notification dots that always seem to adorn their main nav, regardless of whether there's anything new that's worth my attention.

This script appends some CSS that will hide those pieces of LinkedIn's website.

# Installation

* Step 1: Use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).
* Step 1: install the [Greasemonkey addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox.
* Step 2: install [linkedin_decrease_attention_theft.user.js](#). If you've installed Greasemonkey, all you should have to do is click the link, and Greasemonkey will prompt you to install.

That's it!
