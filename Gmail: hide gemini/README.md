# Gmail: Hide "Gemini" in top nav

Even if you disable the so-called _smart_ features, the "Ask Gemini" button in the top right nav persists, tempting you... mocking you. This will remove the button from your sight and from the page's tab order.

# Installation

* Step 1: install the [Greasemonkey addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox or [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome.
* Step 2: install [gmail_hide_gemini.user.js](https://github.com/lshillman/UserScripts/raw/main/Gmail%20-%20hide%20gemini/gmail_hide_gemini.user.js). If you've installed Greasemonkey, all you should have to do is click the link, and Greasemonkey will prompt you to install.

That's it!
