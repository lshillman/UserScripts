# Flickr: bulk change upload date to date taken in Organizr

I go months, sometimes years, without uploading anything to Flickr, and then when I binge-upload, my photostream is all out of order.

This script will allow you to set a bunch of images' upload dates to their taken dates all at once.

# Installation

* Step 1: install the [Greasemonkey addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox or [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome.
* Step 2: install [flickr_bulk_change_upload_dates.user.js](https://github.com/lshillman/UserScripts/raw/main/Flickr:%20bulk%20change%20upload%20dates/flickr_bulk_change_upload_dates.user.js). If you've installed Greasemonkey, all you should have to do is click the link, and Greasemonkey will prompt you to install.

# Usage

* Open an album in the "Organizr"
* double-click the first image in the album
* click the "dates" tab on the popup dialog
* click "click here to change all dates"

That's it!
