# Reset Page Title

Some forum software, *cough* Invision *cough*, prepends a pause icon to page titles after a period of inactivity to indicate that the page is no longer polling for updates in the background. This is confusing and annoying, and I hate it. This script will instantly reset page titles back to their original value as soon as a change is detected.

I originaly wrote this for concertina.net, but you can use it for any site that uses its page title as an attention-grabbing device.

# Installation

* Step 1: install the [Greasemonkey addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox.
* Step 2: install [reset_page_title.user.js](https://github.com/lshillman/UserScripts/raw/main/Reset%20page%20title/reset_page_title.user.js). If you've installed Greasemonkey, all you should have to do is click the link, and Greasemonkey will prompt you to install.

That's it!
