# ProtonMail: Hide scheduled messages in 'Sent' folder

By default, ProtonMail displays scheduled future messages in the 'sent' folder _in addition_ to displaying them in the 'scheduled' folder. If you find this jarring, install this script to hide those messages until they're actually sent.

# Installation

* Step 1: install the [Greasemonkey addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox.
* Step 2: install [protonmail_hide_scheduled.user.js](https://github.com/lshillman/UserScripts/raw/main/ProtonMail%20-%20hide%20scheduled%20messages%20in%20sent%20folder/protonmail_hide_scheduled.user.js). If you've installed Greasemonkey, all you should have to do is click the link, and Greasemonkey will prompt you to install.

That's it!
